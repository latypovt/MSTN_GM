# ðŸ§  Signatures of chronic pain in multiple sclerosis: a machine learning approach to investigate trigeminal neuralgia 
Scripts and code used for the analysis
  
***Primary objective:** Using Freesurfer parcellation to predict TN pain in MS subjects*  


***
## ðŸ’¾ Structure
* **data_preprocessing.py -** retrieves and reorganizes raw MS and MS-TN demographic and featural data so that it can be used by the machine learning model  
* **tSNE.py -** performs dimensionality reduction and visualizes the data structure  
* **model.py -** runs SVM with sequential feature selection to predict TN pain in MS; nested k-fold cross-validation
* **graphs.ipynb -** runs graphic representations of data gathered by the model, as well as an independent t-test
* **stats -** folder for csv files containing featural (from Freesurfer segmentation) and demographic data for each subject
* **utils -** folder for other important files to be used by the model and graphing notebook
* **out -** folder for output files
